# Elevator-Call-Response-Logic-System
The project aims to simulate a logic system for elevator call response using **proteus 8.13**. 
The input will be **2 users' position** and their **call direction** (wnats to go up or, down) & **2 lifts' initial position**.
The lift will be controlled by a **single control system.** 
**Case 1: Both users wants to go up**. The lower user will be the first destination of the selected lift > after reaching its first destonation it will then move to its final destination which is the upper user > then stops.
**Case 2: Both users wants to go down**. The upper user will be the first destination of the selected lift > after reaching its first destonation it will then move to its final destination which is the lower user > then stops.
**Case 3: The direction is not same**. Two lift will be assigned to two users. The lower user will get the priority to be assigned with the lift which is nearer to him. the reamining lift will be assigned to the upper user.
